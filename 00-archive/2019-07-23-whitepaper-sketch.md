#### Vision for Whitepaper

- Introduction to iLien
 - Broad overview of iLien project 
 - Lead in to content
- The Debt-Based Model for Financial Governance 
  - To understand the iLien project, we first need to understand blockchain technology, and why it matters
  - To understand why blockchain technology matters, we first have to understand the old system and some of the problems that affect us in our everyday life
    - Mention the aspect of debt/scarcity/double spend, how its rooted
  - Point of the conversation here is to explain a few things:
    - The different types of banks
    - How banks lend money
    - The rules upon which they must lend money
    - How the Central Bank buys debts
    - How the receipt system is supposed to work, and how it actually works in practice
    - Double spends in action
  - Problems that arise from this model
    - (Problems that we indentify)
- An Introduction to the Blockchain Consensus Mechanism
  - In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced...
  - A key value of this new invention is the ability to prevent a double spend within a confined network
  - This changes the model for financial governance
  - Mention how blockchain technology is useful for many things, but chief among them is this ability to create a "trustless" network, which is especially useful when dealing with money
