# Whitepaper Sketch

## Steps to Take

#### Vision for Whitepaper

- Introduction to iLien
 - Broad overview of iLien project 
 - Lead in to content
- The Debt-Based Model for Financial Governance 
  - To understand the iLien project, we first need to understand blockchain technology, and why it matters
  - To understand why blockchain technology matters, we first have to understand the old system and some of the problems that affect us in our everyday life
    - Mention the aspect of debt/scarcity/double spend, how its rooted
  - Point of the conversation here is to explain a few things:
    - The different types of banks
    - How banks lend money
    - The rules upon which they must lend money
    - How the Central Bank buys debts
    - How the receipt system is supposed to work, and how it actually works in practice
    - Double spends in action
  - Problems that arise from this model
    - (Problems that we indentify)
- An Introduction to the Blockchain Consensus Mechanism
  - In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced...
  - A key value of this new invention is the ability to prevent a double spend within a confined network
  - This changes the model for financial governance
  - Mention how blockchain technology is useful for many things, but chief among them is this ability to create a "trustless" network, which is especially useful when dealing with money
    - make sure to keep clear between "in trust" and "trustless"
  - How the Blockchain Consensus Mechanism presents an initial solution for mitigating the damages caused by the debt-based model
- An Introduction to iLien
  - The new system of cryptocurrency now exists and the infrastructure is coming into place
  - The old system still exists, and we need to create an incentive to take what's left of the old model, and transfer the value therein to the new model, and to do this in a manner that creates a model no of Debt, but of Abundance
- What is an Abundance Model
  - Details around the model of abundance
  - Sources and examples that show how the model of abundance can solve the larger problems that are found in the Debt system
  - (Counter points, if necessary, and responses)
- How iLien Transfers Value from the Old System to Value of the New System
  - Weaknesses in the Old System
    - Recall that there is no receipt issued
    - The debt technically never ends
      - Remains "in trust"
      - May be settled, but the debt remains "in trust" 
  - iLien uses the existing system to call the bank to account for a receipt
    - iLien grants a certain amount of time to produce the receipt, and if it's not produced, then iLien uses the existing legal system to hold the bank to account
  - iLien makes the value of the ILN token equal the value of all liens held against the government
