# Whitepaper Sketch

## Steps to Take

#### Vision for Whitepaper

- Introduction to iLien
 - Broad overview of iLien project 
 - Lead in to content
- The Debt-Based Model for Financial Governance 
  - To understand the iLien project, we first need to understand blockchain technology, and why it matters
  - To understand why blockchain technology matters, we first have to understand the old system and some of the problems that affect us in our everyday life
    - Mention the aspect of debt/scarcity/double spend, how its rooted
  - Point of the conversation here is to explain a few things:
    - The different types of banks
    - How banks lend money
    - The rules upon which they must lend money
    - How the Central Bank buys debts
    - How the receipt system is supposed to work, and how it actually works in practice
    - Double spends in action
  - Problems that arise from this model
    - (Problems that we indentify)
- An Introduction to the Blockchain Consensus Mechanism
  - In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced...
  - A key value of this new invention is the ability to prevent a double spend within a confined network
  - This changes the model for financial governance
  - Mention how blockchain technology is useful for many things, but chief among them is this ability to create a "trustless" network, which is especially useful when dealing with money
    - make sure to keep clear between "in trust" and "trustless"
  - How the Blockchain Consensus Mechanism presents an initial solution for mitigating the damages caused by the debt-based model
- An Introduction to iLien
  - The new system of cryptocurrency now exists and the infrastructure is coming into place
  - The old system still exists, and we need to create an incentive to take what's left of the old model, and transfer the value therein to the new model, and to do this in a manner that creates a model no of Debt, but of Abundance
- What is an Abundance Model
  - Details around the model of abundance
  - Sources and examples that show how the model of abundance can solve the larger problems that are found in the Debt system
  - (Counter points, if necessary, and responses)
- How iLien Transfers Value from the Old System to Value of the New System
  - Weaknesses in the Old System
    - Recall that there is no receipt issued
    - The debt technically never ends
      - Remains "in trust"
      - May be settled, but the debt remains "in trust" 
  - iLien uses the existing system to call the bank to account for a receipt
    - iLien grants a certain amount of time to produce the receipt, and if it's not produced, then iLien uses the existing legal system to hold the bank to account
  - Formation of ILN
    - ILN is all receipted
    - Not debt based
    - The conversion contract is based on the receipt
      - Can we place these images into the actual database? Seems very interesting
    - Cleaning out the debt of the old system
    - The only cryptocurrency that is not debt based
      - Can compare to other cryptocurrencies, also
  - How does ILN create an abundance-based model
    - Discuss how currency that is provably scarce and is not issued over debt is a healthy system
- ILN Method of Creation and Distribution
  - History
      - Discuss the legal method in which ILN was originally concenceived, registered, created (according to the old system)
      - (Maybe mention here the details behind the team, and where your expertise comes into play)
      - Any other historical background
  - ILN intends to solve X Amount of the System
    - What are the limits and bounds of the ILN project
    - Other blockchain projects can copy this model
    - The maximum amount of value that the ILN project can clean is X amount, according to the token model
    - X amount was originally distributed as an airdrop to all Komodo holders
  - The iLien team takes lien from the public, searches for liens that are suitable for the iLien method, and then performs the legal actions necessary to "clean" the debt
  - Once the debt is cleaned, iLien then issues tokens that are tied to the value of the debt at that point in time
    - How does this relate to the gold value of iLien
  - Method of disbursal
    - Those who hold (X) token receive airdrops of the value
  - This ILN token now is legally tied to the value of gold, and can be spent or traded in accordance, according to the desire of the user
- Stable coin value
  - Value is legally associated with 1 gram of gold at the time the ILN is issued to the community
  - The value is the work of the community in cleaning debts and double spends held in the old system
  - Scarcity vs abundance
  - Gold, and the gold meteor
  - Diamond market
  - ILN goes to the holders
  - Traditional Supply & Demand model is flawed
  - Comparing to currencies that are debt based
  - As a planet, we have never been debt-free, since before the pharoahs
    - (Do we need to cover this history in the introduction?)
  - See peers entering a system of abundance
  - The price you want to trade it, is your business
    - You don't need to make a profit at this
    - There's plenty of this where it came from
  - Adding to the value of Bitcoin
    - Bitcoin was set up as an experiment
  - Difference between inherent and exchange values
  - ILN avoids debt-based relationships
  - ILN master nodes
    - Project managers
- Notes
  - Explain issues with scarcity
  - Show aspect of world being in debt since time of the pharaohs
  - Time of Solomon
  - The new concept of "Trust"
  - Show currency systems that fail, within the debt-based model
  - Ark of the covenant - a bend on the contract - taking the contract away from its final destination
    - Brue nebueneh: the bend in the good
    - Compare the Holy Books to the Historical Books
